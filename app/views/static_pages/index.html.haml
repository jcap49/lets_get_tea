        =link_to 'laughter and ridicule of this site', 'http://media.giphy.com/media/qj9OmQTC7ARfW/giphy.gif'  
        by saying I actually had tea with a cool person.

        You get to talk about yourself (if you want)! I promise this is not a job interview. Seriously.
      %li
        I'm fun. I promise!

            I just returned from a gap year in London and San Francisco.
          %li 
            I was a part-time ski bum this past winter.
          %li 
            I cook and dig swapping recipes and other food-related banter.

        So you can tell your parents you met some stranger from the internet this week AND you survived to tell the tale.

      Just in case you’re a bit worried about not having anything to talk about, I spent a minute putting together a tidy list of fun conversation topics as follows: adventure movies from the 90’s, beer, Californian wine, mountains, cumulus clouds, waterskiing, backcountry snowboarding, parks in Amsterdam, beer halls in Munich, beer halls in Amsterdam, the earth, the moon, space, the International Space Station, what/if, Pink Floyd, airplanes, submarines, cooking, Italian cooking, cooking French, v-neck t-shirts, yellow watches, cuffed jeans, surfing in San Francisco, backpacking in Thailand, diving in Mexico, sleeping in space, fire, how to make a fire, why everyone should eat a donut at least once, banned books, banned poetry, the best toothbrush on this planet, favorite things to do in Boston, favorite things to do in San Francisco, simple favorite things to do, and so the list continues.
